<p style="font-size:20pt">Techno is enraged at their formation of a new Government and shoots Tubbo. Wilbur meanwhile, runs away and denotates the TnT in the presence of Philza - who just joined. Techno then sets off a pair of Withers, aided by Dream. The newly renamed L’Manburg is all blown up. 

=>The withers are defeated. Philza kills Wilbur. Tommy affirms that Tubbo is still the president as they go listen to a music disc together, and they plan to rebuild everything in spite of Techno being out there - now their greatest adversary. 

This marks the end of Season 1</p><a href="index.html">click here to go to the homepage</a>
