<h1 style="color:#D12020" >summary of the smp(season 1 )</h1>
<p  style="color:#D12020" >When Tommy joins the SMP, it is a very small server. Members are Dream, George, Sapnap, Alyssa and Ponk. Callahan and BadboyHalo are also whitelisted, but don’t really play. That said, they’ve built the Community house, the nether area and a few other buildings and things and have had some scuffles with each other, such as burning down Ponk’s lemon tree. 

Anyway, Tommy makes his humble home in the side of a hill as Tubbo, Fundy and Punz also join the server. Purpled joins too a couple days later. There’s some conflicts and things and Tommy find two music discs, Mellohi and Cat. 

 So you got the disc war, where Tommy (and Sapnap) were picking a fight with Dream, causing him to take the music discs from him as a punishment. Tommy was therefore trying to reacquire his music discs, Cat and Mellohi, back from Dream. This ended with them both safely inside his ender chest. During this little saga was also where Wilbur invited Dream to meet him in Brighton. Wilbur supposedly met up up with both George and Dream though the promised Vlog never came out (and its since been revealed that he only met up with George). 

=> Over the next little while, things were normal. Many towers and structures were built on the server. There were a few smaller conflicts, like Tommy accidentally killing Tubbo’s bee. I believe Eret joined the server over this time period. Jschlatt also got whitelisted onto the server, played for a few hours before being banned, likely due to the outcry on twitter (Dream claims it was unrelated but let’s not pretend that wasn’t a factor), Tommy loved the experience of playing with Jschlatt because he’s like his hero and highly values both the Cuck shed, which he built, and Blocks, the music disc he listened to with him.<a href="storyline pt2.html" class="button">click to go to part 2</a></p>
