	<p>In the Aftermath, some rebuilding is done. Niki and Jack Manifold both join the server and join L’Manberg - though Dream tries to tempt Jack away. Things begin to get back to normal though Tommy is still anxious to get his discs back. Quackity and later Karl Jacobs both join the server too.

Fundy was not done though. He wanted further revenge on Sapnap, so he and Niki killed one of his <a href="storyline pt4.html">click here to continue </a></p>
